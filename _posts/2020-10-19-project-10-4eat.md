# Landing Page 4eat

4eat is a company from Bras√≠lia that sells frozen lunch boxes. The project consisted of proposing a new landing page for the site in order to improve the usability in a new layout. To achieve this layout, it was necessary to understand the company's niche and how similar companies communicate with their customers, in addition to following 4eat's visual identity. The project has not yet been completed due to company administrative issues.
