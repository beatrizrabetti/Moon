# Checkpoint camp

To create the name and visual identity of the checkpoint camp, we used brainstorming sessions with the leadership team. After this, I studied to define the color palette, typography and visual elements and then approved with the team. For the camp several materials were made: for promotion on Instagram, printed materials, notebook, cup, stamps and etc.
