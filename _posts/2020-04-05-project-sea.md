# Challenge - Sea Tecnologia

The project was a challenge proposed by the company Sea Tecnologia. I was running for a job and the challenge was to make a screen prototype of an intranet for the company. I had a week to perform. It was the first complete prototype I designed and the first experience of interviewing users to understand their needs and desires for a digital project. In the end, I got the job and it was my first job in the area of ​​UX / UI design.
