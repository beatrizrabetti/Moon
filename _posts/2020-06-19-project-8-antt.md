# Internet Portal ANTT

ANTT is a Brazilian federal agency responsible for regulating the activities of exploitation of the federal rail and road infrastructure and the provision of land transportation services. ANTT's Internet portal required an initial study of the new standard established by gov.br, a study of the information architecture that had on its old website, study of the user who accesses the portal and use of dynamics to understand how to improve the distribution of information to the user. From the understanding of how it would be organized, we started designing interfaces, initially with wireframes and later with high-fidelity prototypes, all the time validating with the clients. We did dynamics to verify the usability of the interfaces. The project feedback was very positive, the client was surprised by the product delivered and said that this is the best portal the agency has ever had.
