# Além de mim / Beyond me

I have had the opportunity to volunteer at the church several times and for a long time I worked with design for young people. These projects are an example of some I've done. It was a series of messages called "Além de mim" which in English means "beyond me". To create this visual identity we used brainstorming dynamics with the leadership team, briefings to understand the theme and then I was able to think about the color palette, typography and visual elements for this series of messages.
