# OKR na prática / OKR in practice

"OKR na prática" was part of the course at the Gama Academy. The proposal was to create a blog to get as many leads as possible. The theme of the blog, the name, the website codes and all the visual identity were done in one week. The group was composed of people from design, development, sales and digital marketing. During the week we also created personas, empathy map and did usability tests.
